# Cloud Portal Automation for SD-WAN Routers
## Overview
This repository contains automation scripts developed during my internship, designed to streamline the management and configuration of SD-WAN routers through a cloud portal. The automation leverages Python and Selenium to create an efficient, secure, and scalable workflow for router flashing and cloud portal interaction.
## Features
- Automatic Router Management: Automates the process of reading device paths and credentials from secure input files.
- Cloud Portal Management: Enables automatic provisioning, monitoring, and management of SD-WAN routers through a cloud portal.
- Credential Security: Enhances security by using encrypted input files for router paths and credentials.
## Usage
- Automating Cloud Portal Operations - to automate the process of logging in, provisioning routers, and monitoring through the cloud portal.
- Automating Router Provisioning - to automatically add and configure SD-WAN routers on the cloud portal.
- Monitoring Router Health - to monitor the health and status of routers at regular intervals
